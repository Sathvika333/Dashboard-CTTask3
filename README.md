Task Description:
This project involved the development of an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze customer investment preferences based on survey data. The objective of the analysis was to understand investment behaviors, key influencing factors, preferred channels of information, and the demographic segmentation of individuals who are actively making investment decisions. This type of analysis is valuable for financial service providers, policy makers, and investment advisors aiming to tailor their services and communication strategies based on user behavior and preferences.

The dataset used for the analysis included information from 40 individuals, segmented by gender, age group, investment habits, decision factors, and financial goals. Demographically, the majority of investors (75%) were in the 18–25 age group, while 25% were from the 26–35 age group. The gender distribution revealed that out of 40 individuals, 25 were male and 15 were female, indicating a higher male engagement in investment-related decisions.

One of the key focuses of the analysis was to understand the factors influencing investment decisions. Among the respondents, the top influencing factor was “Returns”, selected by 25 individuals, followed by “Risk” and “Locking Period”. This suggests that while maximizing returns remains a top priority, risk assessment also plays a significant role in shaping investment choices.

Another important dimension explored was the objectives of savings. The analysis showed that most individuals were saving for retirement planning, followed by healthcare and education. Additionally, the duration of investment preferences was analyzed, with most respondents (45%) preferring investments with a duration of 1–3 years, indicating a short- to mid-term outlook.

The frequency of investment monitoring was also considered, showing that a majority of investors (29) review their investments on a monthly basis, while 7 monitor weekly, and 4 check daily. This helps in understanding how actively people engage with their investments after committing capital.

The dashboard also examined the sources of investment information. Most individuals reported relying on financial consultants and newspapers/magazines, followed by television and the internet. This insight is helpful for targeting future educational campaigns or product awareness programs.

A critical part of the analysis was the use of a Sankey diagram to trace the flow between the investment factors (Returns, Risk), objectives (Capital Appreciation, Income), and the broader purpose (Wealth Creation, Growth, Savings for Future). This visual representation effectively illustrated that most people who prioritize returns as a factor are aiming for capital appreciation, ultimately driven by the desire for wealth creation.

Additional insights included the stock market participation, where a majority of the respondents had invested in the stock market and other investment avenues. Gender-wise analysis of gold investments showed that males invested more in gold than females, contributing to gender-based investment strategy insights.
